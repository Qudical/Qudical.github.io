            <h2>About the game</h2>
            <p>COMING HOME is a retro slasher horror game, with a focus on home defense.
                <br><br>In the dead of night, you hear someone lurking outside - but you are not defenseless.
                Watch the cameras, barricade your doors, and have your gun at the ready - anything to keep the Sundown Rippers from claiming their next victim.</p>
